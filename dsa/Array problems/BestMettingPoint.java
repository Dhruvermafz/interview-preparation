/**
 *
 * A group of two or more people wants to meet and minimize the total travel distance.
 * You are given a 2D grid of values 0 or 1, where each 1 marks the home of someone in the group.
 * The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|.
 * Find the total distance that needs to be travelled to reach this meeting point.
 *
 * Time complexity O(m*n)
 * Space complexity O(m + n)
