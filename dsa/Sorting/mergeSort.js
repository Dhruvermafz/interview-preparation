// merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm, it divides the orignial array into smaller arrya until each array has only one position left, then it merges the smaller arrays into a bigger one that is sorted.

function mergeSort(arr, compare = defaultCompare) {
    if (arr.length > 1) {
        const {length} = arr;
        const middle = Math.floor()
    }
