Create a new issue.
Please use a clear and descriptive title that summarizes the issue.
You can either contribute and resolve the issue yourself, or you can patiently await someone else to address it. It's important to note that simply opening a new issue is also appreciated and recognized.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to me or open an issue.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
